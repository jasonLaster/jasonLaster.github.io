      Chrome DevTools is a ubiquitous web developer tool.
      It is easy to use it every day and take it for granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this series, I explore some of DevTool's inner-workings.

      The format I chose, is a simple question and answer one.
      I wanted to know how one aspect worked, and I recorded my findings as I went.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope some of these questions encourage you to jump in aswell.
